# Audio-based Insect Classification using CNN & Transfer Learning  

This project classifies insect species based on their **audio recordings**, using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning** to enhance pest monitoring efficiency.  

## Features  
- Converts insect audio into **Mel-spectrograms** for analysis  
- **CNN model** fine-tuned with **Transfer Learning** for higher accuracy  
- Evaluated with **accuracy, precision, recall & F1-score**  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, **Scikit-learn**, **Librosa**  

## Workflow  
1. Preprocess audio (noise reduction & spectrogram generation)  
2. Train CNN using Transfer Learning (e.g., VGG16)  
3. Evaluate performance using test metrics  

## Results  
- Achieved **high accuracy** with transfer learning  
- Shows potential for **real-time agricultural pest monitoring**  

## Future Scope  
- Expand dataset & add **real-time recordings**  
- Deploy as **IoT-enabled monitoring system**
